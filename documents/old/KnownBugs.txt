-------------KNOWN BUGS:

* conversation key error: if player initially messes up selecting a or b in
their conversation options, they must leave the room to restart the conversation
with the NPC

* no stop player from going back

* no inventory drawbacks between morphing player types (e.g. lioness can hold 2 items)

* bark/roar/squawk does nothing useful towards game

* CHECKSTYLE: complexItem -  Got an exception - expecting EOG, found '}'

-------------FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
* time constraints (must play first and walkthrough)
* add/lost points (" " ")



* WIN DETERMINE CREATURE.

-------------PLAYER AESTHETICS:

* * clarification between NPC's (cubs, zebras) maybe diff names?
* " 	"	" (tuna, school of fish, herd)
* make names easier (e.g. blue-billed bird >>>> tucan? + sign - savanna)

* player needs more information to know what to do in beginning of game
	-encourage spelling!
	-background - point of game
	-explain help command to list commands
	-explain mission plots 
	-maybe more NPC's?
	-descriptions for items
	
	* "\n" after each string to help reader visibility

* make descriptions more independent of their creatures/items
	
* "help" command more than 80 char.

-------------PROGRAMMER AESTHETICS:
* check out all //'s
* check out all method comments and rearrange
* remove unnecessary stuff + run checkstyle
